The names of the folders are quite self-explanatory! The different scripts and programs used in this projects are stored in folders corresponding to the language they were written in. 

- `C/` scripts for the stochastic individual-based simulations,
- `Mathematica/` for the analytical part,
- `R/` to plot the figures.  

Each folder has its own `README.md` file.
