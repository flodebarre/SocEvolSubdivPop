Curves look nicer. 
- Started even more simulations to smoothen the curves.
- Launched new ones with larger population size (30 demes).

# 20161202
Simulations downloaded from Migale, 
script written in R to plot them quickly
-> result still holds with strong selection!
Sent a few more simulations to Migale to have more points. 


# 20161201
I had forgotten to update the name of the results file (.txt), so all simulations with different values of omega were saved on the same file, erasing the previous one...   
Running the simulations again (submitted at 14:34).

# 20161130
Updated the scripts from the Sigma project to add changes in the intensity of selection.  
Sent the simulations on the Migale cluster (135 simulations) at 15:30.
