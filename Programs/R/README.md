- `.R` scripts:

   - `AllFigs.R` is a script to plot all Figures at once,
   - `globalGraphParms.R` contains graphical parameters (e.g. colors),
   - `loadData.R` is a script to... load the simulation data, 
   - `Rplots.R` plots the panels of Figure 1,
   - `EXplots.R` plots the panels of Figure 2, and supplementary Figures S1-S4.
   - `explainDB.R` plots the panels of Figure 3,
   - `Qplots.R` plots the panels of Figure S5,
 
- `Pics/` folder, contains the pdf of the generated figures.

*NB* There are commands to open the newly created figures (`system("xdg-open...")`). This only works with Unix. With a Mac, you need to replace `xdg-open` by `open`. On Windows... I don't know! But it does not matter, you can always open the files manually!
